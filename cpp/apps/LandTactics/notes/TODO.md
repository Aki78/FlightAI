- 2D object like houses or trees stored in SquareGrid datastructure, raycasting these objects in 2D and 2.5D
- DONE: Ray-casting against terrain in 2.5D ... draw line-of-sight curve around unitï»¿ 


- Units are companies of several soldiers or vehicles (e.g. tanks)
    - they are able to automatically search cover with respect to specified direction or enemies
    - search of cover takes into account passive object nearbye and terrain.
    
    
    cover system - each terrain has typicall height of cover, this cover is substracted to crossection of combatant. However, combatants which are smaller than cover cannot use that cover.
