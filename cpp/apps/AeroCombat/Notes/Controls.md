# Mouse + Keys

Generally we want to use 2 analog axis of mouse to set ammount (How strongly) we should steer pitch,jaw and roll. But at the same time we want to use mouse look. Also we want to relax axes.

### version 1

* mouse sets target for control surface to which it should converge. 
* tap/hold keys kX to converge on x-axis.
* tap/hold keys kX to relax  of x-axis.
