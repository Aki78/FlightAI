# Simple

* make visible projectiles, so player can see some effects of cannons (curve on which they move)
  * ad some targets ( like moving on some curve, or aircrafts with stupid AI )
* Aircraft control mouse-aim like in warthunder
* test set of manuevers which Long-Shot is usually doing

# more work

* loading lua scripts to perform test manuevers
