- LinearAlgebra
  - Sparse Matrix-vector multiplication
  - Sparse [conjugate graient method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method)
     - use [Cholesky factorization preconditioner ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_Cholesky_factorization) 
- NBody dynamics
    - Rigid Molecule dynamics 
- Soft-Body (Truss) simulation
	- General mesh
	- Regular grid (fcc,bcc) ~= (fuller octet,octahedral)-truss
	- Curtain (without any flexular rigidity) 
- Visibility between N-Agents in environment
	- in grid (bicubic spline) based map
	- in environment composed of spherical bounded objects 
- Projectile collision vs environment collision 
	- in grid (bicubic spline) based map
	- in environment composed of spherical bounded objects 
- Convolution like
	- Fluid simulation

	- Potential Flow solver in 3D 
	    - for aircraft body
	    - use short range turbulence seeds to simulate viscosity effecst ?
	    - with inter surface interaction (vortex lattice method) - (like http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/avl/)
- Procedural noise turbulence - movement of particles over turbulent field (Jupiter)
