- AnalyticVolume, AnalyticSurface, RayMarch
- High quality render vs. interactive preview
	- Large size image
	- add all rendering efects
	- Interactive preview (By just meshes) can react to mouse (mouse picking)
- Scene composed of multiple shapes with mesh-bounding boxes
	- Scene description composed of description of mesh BBoxes (CPU side, javascript, C++) and of GLSL shaders inside
		- Custom scene-descripiton language can reorganize it (put BBox and shader under common class)
- Multiple pass render 
	- assembling objects using Depth-buffer
	- deffered rendering e.g. for SSAO
