- **Locality and sychronization**
	- Nearest nighbor search
	- Parallel computing
	- computer clusters
	- Networking

- **Simplicity v performance tradeof**
	- Why dynamic languages  are simpler, and more expressive and hi-performance (C++,Fortran,CL) more cumbersome
	- Interfacing code and hardware
		- python C++ interface
		- GPU interface
	- specialization of code
		- for different architectures
		- for different datatypes
			- (e.g. why)
		
- **Easy Metaprograming**
	- templates too cumbersamo in C++
	- dynamic programing is still simpler (less mental burden) than 
	- interfacing heterogenous architectures
		- python C++ interface
		- GPU interface OpenGL/OpenCl

- **Resource initialization and reclaim**
	- Memory management
	- file management
	- use of heterogeneous architectures OpenGL/OpenCl
