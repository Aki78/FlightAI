### Obligations against expanse



### My version of exapnse 
- not trying to be original, just what I sketch something reasonable
- settings / topic : Initial phase of space collonization
- Space is colonized mostly by autonomous robots with AI. Since it is economically un-feasible for un-modified humans to live and work in space. This does not mean that it is not possible - the technology for life suport is full y mature and it is fairly easy to life in space with luxurious life if you wan't and if you are able to pay for it. But it does not make any sense economycally to host many workers in space (like miners, engineers ...). There may be small numbe of high-end professionals in order to supplement machines.

- Most importaint role of humans is political - they carry will and power. This does not mean that computers are unable to generate autonomous intentions or motivations alone (purely artificial), but simply for historical reasons people were there first, and those who were able to gain cotrol of inteligent machines naturally posses these machines by they will. 

 Actually un-modified humans does not have much work also on earth, but due to inertia of society, traditions, and conservative political institutions un-modified people has still large part in society. Their living requirements are subvenced by basic income.
