## What is is ?

Project dedicated to imagination of space-combat in solar system in near future based on realistic physics. 
It is inspired and strogly influences by [Project Rho: Atomic rockets](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/) webpages.
Here I try to complement that great project by calculations, simulations and visualizations using modern interactive media (Jupyter notebook, HTML5, javascript, WebGL ) 
and by my personal views on some aspects of space combat. In some aspects my oppinion can slightly deviate from Project Rho, but mostly we share agenda to promote hard-scify, 
and disclaim commont fault of superficial sci-fy. We both try to extrapolate how space combat may really look like in future. 

## How to read it?

Easies way is to open ``ch1_basics.ipynb`` through ```nbviewer.jupyter.org``` by following link:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ProkopHapala/SimpleSimulationEngine/blob/master/projects/SpaceCombat/ch1_basics.ipynb

other option is to download the notebook locally on your computer and open it using ipython (easiest form linux terminal) by command: 

```
$ jupyter notebook ch1_basics.ipynb
```

for HTML with javascript use: http://htmlpreview.github.io/ for example:

https://rawgit.com/ProkopHapala/SimpleSimulationEngine/master/projects/SpaceCombat/HTML/StickSpaceCraft.html

for offline browsing use python web server
```
$ cd ~/git/SimpleSimulationEngine/projects/SpaceCombat/HTML
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and than in web browser open http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Tools used

- Jupyter/IPython notebooks ( graphics by matplotlib, posibly POVray)
- HTML5 + Javascript + WebGL for 3D rendering
- Latex and HTML / wiki documnation
- Matplotlib and POVray for graphics
- python and bash script to glue all. It will render all figures and latex
