# FlightAI

A physically accurate flight simulator made by [Prokop Hapala](https://github.com/ProkopHapala) for building and testing RL AIs for planes. Current attempt is using the RL algorithm, TD(0) with PyTorch for diciding on the rate of change of the angles of the flaps, but it hasn't learned to flight properly yet.
